# Link
### What It Does: 
The Link component lets you move between different pages in a React app without refreshing the whole page.
### Why Use It:
Instead of using a regular a tag, which reloads the page, Link keeps everything smooth.
# NavLink
### What It Does:
The NavLink component is like Link, but it can highlight the link for the current page.
### Why Use It:
It helps users see which page they're on by changing the style of the active link.
